# markdown2html-regex

A simple script to convert markdown files to html using regex replacement. The `helper.js` file is just a server that fetches `markdown.md` and passes it through the script (`markdown.js`) before serving the result. It reloads `markdown.js` on each request so I can immediately see the effects of any changes I made to the script.
